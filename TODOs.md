Molstar:
- [x] alpha/beta colors
- [x] correct ligands initialization in monomer view
- [x] standardize color variables across the repo 
- [x] hiding model on the MSA range
- [x] override default click behaviours
- [ ] fix slider color interactions

- nonpolymer initalization with congruent colors 
- focusing on nonpoly -- hide others..

- on residue hover, on click focus (within a sensible range)
- flesh out the ligand panel (WHERE THE FUCK DOES TAXOL BIND?)

- Establish correctness of annotations!
- fix and verify ligands
- [x] extend nightingale

- Enrich the easy mode with metadata and such
- links and popups to other structures everywhere
- Rework the ui for the "expert mode" to be more like a toolbox as opposed to a single panel
    - polymer navigator with the filters :
                filters                | Default
                -----------------------|----------------------
